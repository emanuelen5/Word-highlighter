# Word highlighter for Sublime Text
The plugin is meant as a replacement for the Emacs plugin [highlight-symbol](http://nschum.de/src/emacs/highlight-symbol/). I will add some examples to show how it works when I get the time.

[The Wiki page](https://github.com/emanuelen5/Word-highlighter/wiki) will be populated with info on how it works.
